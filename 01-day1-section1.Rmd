# Introduction {#intro}

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).

## Day 1 thoughts

Day 1:
- Data literacy 
- including R data types (as maps to visualization and interpretation)
- Identifying different types of data
- Factors, numeric, character strings, logicals 
- Why it matters
- Variable types
- Mapping how to put data into a variable types ( numeric, character, factor )
- Variable structures
- Know what a vector is 
- Know what dataframe is
- How to identify and inspect
- Logic and conditionals 
- Evaluating things as TRUE and FALSE
- Operators like ==, !=, >, <
- How to do "if"
- Functions
- Looking at documentation and using the help function
- Using functions
- Understanding arguments
- Preliminary data investigation
- Using functions on vectors and dataframe columns to calculate summary statistics
- Picking the type of plot based on the available data or the research question
- Use hist() to plot a histogram of some numeric vector
- Use plot() to compare two vectors
- use plot() to demonstrate that there's a bunch of other named arguments (title), and that documentation can be extensive in ?plot

## Another subsection

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```
