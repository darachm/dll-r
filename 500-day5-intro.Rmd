# Day 5 - workflows, loops, packages, and help

Today we're going to learn about applying these R 
skills to 
repeat, reproduce, extend, and share your analyses.

First, let's review the last two days.

<!-- exercise -->

<!--are we trying to make students think about writing functions and clean code? I'm not sure that's clear if this is asynchronous reading-->

- What have we done?
- Crack open your code - can you use it again?
- Can you adapt it to modify your question, 
  feed in new data, and modify the
  scientifically-important bits easily?
- Can you share it with someone and they follow
  along?

Our goals are to learn how to:

- organize work in a folder and rmarkdown files
- build a workflow analyzing some viral proteins in a *scalable* way
- modify our workflow to expand the analyses
- obtain and use packages to user other people's work
- tackling new problems with new R packages

**Preparing for Today:**
Please make sure you have completed all readings and activities from 
Section 3: Day 4 - tidyverse and visualizations. 

Before you start reading through Section 4 for today or taking part in
