# Day 5 - building workflows

Today we're going to learn about applying these R 
skills to 
repeat, reproduce, extend, and share your analyses.

First, let's review the last two days.

<!-- exercise -->

- What have we done?
- How do we do it many times?
- Crack open your code - can you use it again?
- Can you adapt it to modify your question, 
  feed in new data, and modify the
  scientifically-important bits easily?
- Can you share it with someone and they follow
  along?

Our goals are to learn how to:

- read lots of files, and different kinds of delimited files
- use loops to do similar steps for many inputs
- obtain and use packages to user other people's work
- how to get more help and documentation
- write code, and design workflows, while thinking about future readers/users
- design steps/chunks of work as modular functions to make adaptable workflows
- more fun tricks in generating Rmarkdown reports

**Preparing for Today:**
Please make sure you have completed all readings and activities from Section 3: Day 4 - tidyverse and visualizations. You will also have some time at the start of the day to do the first sections 4.1-4.3.
