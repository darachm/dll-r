# Day 5 - building workflows, loops, using packages, and finding help in new areas

Today we're going to learn about applying these R 
skills to 
repeat, reproduce, extend, and share your analyses.

First, let's review the last two days.

<!-- exercise -->

- What have we done?
- How do we do it many times?
- Crack open your code - can you use it again?
- Can you adapt it to modify your question, 
  feed in new data, and modify the
  scientifically-important bits easily?
- Can you share it with someone and they follow
  along?

---

Our goals are to learn how to:

- organize work in a folder and rmarkdown file, 


- read lots of files, and different kinds of delimited files
- use loops to do similar steps for many inputs
- obtain and use packages to user other people's work
- how to get more help and documentation
- write code, and design workflows, while thinking about future readers/users
- design steps/chunks of work as modular functions to make adaptable workflows
- more fun tricks in generating Rmarkdown reports

**Preparing for Today:**
Please make sure you have completed all readings and activities from 
Section 3: Day 4 - tidyverse and visualizations. 

Before you start reading through Section 4 for today or taking part in
synchronous activities, download and [open today's
worksheet](https://github.com/darachm/dll-r/blob/main/worksheets/dll-r_Day5_Lab.Rmd).
On this Github page, please right-click the button that says "Raw" and click
"Save Link As..." to get a local copy of this Rmd file on your computer and
open it in Rstudio.
