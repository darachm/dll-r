## What is a workflow?

What does it take to do an analysis?

When you embark on some project, it's helpful (but not necessary) to plan
where you are going. 
It's best to setup and keep track of factors like:

- What data am I analyzing? What format is it in, and is that going to change?
    Will there be a lot more of this data that I want to process in the future?
- What kind of analyses do I want to do? What major steps do I have in my 
    process? _What work from others can I re-use and build upon?_
- What do I want to generate? What is the desired outcome, and for whom is
    this intended?

In the author's experience, bioinformatic workflows often involve reading in
big (or many) flat files, processing the data into a useful form, sometimes
using extra packages to analyze the data, then generating plots and statistical
summaries of what you found - usually in an Rmarkdown-generated report.
