We want to get you to a basic framework so you can work with someone effectively. That framework is getting you oriented with the basics and how to think about figuring out tasks in R. 1.2 Structure and resources 1.2.1 This syllabus and videos We‚Äôve made this doc for your reference, and it‚Äôs our living document of ‚Äúslides‚Äù and reference. We also made short videos for teaching, so that any mini-lectures are concise and complete. It also allows us to work as assistants. These are uploaded on Youtube, and should be accessible via the embeds on this site. 1.2.2 Slack channel We are going to set this up to be a good place to go for ideas/help. The channel is called ‚Ä¶. what? 1.3 Expectations Don‚Äôt be a jerk Pull together "],["day-4-into-to-r.html", "2 Day 4 - into to R", " 2 Day 4 - into to R Day 4: Automation, workflows, Loops and apply?

What have we done and how do we do it again? Crack open your code - can you use it again? Can you adapt it to modify your question, feed in new data, and modify the scientifically-important bits easily? 4.1 Writing (re)usable code Let‚Äôs look at two chunks of code from a paper (lightly edited). The experiment is counting barcoded lineages of yeast cells to estimate ‚ÄúPPIs‚Äù (protein-protein interactions)1. here‚Äôs an example of one style of writing R script: # filter out bad barcode lineages ( &lt;= 2 time points counts &gt; 0, or maximum of each time point &lt;= 5 or total counts of a lineage &lt; 10) bad_index = rep(0, nrow(DBC_known_counts)) for(i in 1:length(bad_index)){ counts = as.numeric(DBC_known_counts[i, 4:8]) if (length(which(counts != 0)) &lt; 3 | max(counts) &lt; 5 | sum(counts) &lt; 10){ bad_index[i] = 1 } } length(which(bad_index == 1)) # 1447775 What is going on here? How do you feed in new data? How do you run this multiple times? How do you change the logic? Here‚Äôs another example from the same author: H202_Output &lt;- PPI_calling_sigmoid( PPI_multiple=dataFrameReader_T(&quot;/Volumes/zmliu_02/PPiseq_03/H2O2/counts/PPI_multiple_p.values.csv&quot;), specific_PPV=c(seq(0.5,0.58,by=0.02),seq(0.6,0.8,by=0.01),seq(0.82,0.9,by=0.02)), Fitness=fitness(0,1,0.01), p_value=seq(-4,0,0.1), Neg_number_PPI=6e4, Neg_ref_number=50, p_threshold=-4 p_loc=6, ) Same questions. 4.1.1 Style guides can be inspiring tidyverse style guide google-specific changes Jean Fan‚Äôs search for ‚ÄúR style guide‚Äù 4.1.2 What style should you use? Be inconsistently consistent! Balance for yourself: How easy is it to write? How easy is it for you to read? How easy is it for others to read? How similar is it to what everyone else is doing (a very good thing)? But most importantly, use what folks around you are using. Be lazy, imitate others. How would you describe your code writing style? How do you name things? How good are your comments? What elements would you like to incorporate? 4.2 Writing modular code What is modularity of code? Why? think more clearly than ‚Äúhardcoding‚Äù stuff change things more easily without forgetting everything lets you operate at a higher level, by tweaking parameters in one place 4.2.1 Calculating standard error Let‚Äôs calculate the standard error of a sample of values: values &lt;- c(4,3,2,2,5,3,6,2,2,4) stderr(values) ## Error in stderr(values): unused argument (values) Er ‚Ä¶ what? What is stderr doing? ?stderr Write out the maths for the standard error of the mean calcuate it sd(values)/sqrt(length(values)-1) ## [1] 0.4727122 write a function that does it what do we save it as? test it 4.2.2 More complex modules More examples/exercise show a simulation of something‚Ä¶. genetic drift of a virus replicating? lineage G1312F exercise - wrap the entire analysis as a function talk about ease of calling gotcha about print() the plots exercise - make a parameter and argument ease of tweaking this exercise - break into subfunctions, generate and plot ease of changing models 4.3 Using modules many times - loops Doing lots of stuff - loops (Darach) show list.files() - challenge is to analyze a bunch of ‚Ä¶.. ? protein seqs? could evaluate the claim that four basic amino acids in a row is unusual for SARS2 (ever seen a NLS?) Loops How to think about a for loop Specifically in context of processing multiple files, so list.files() ? Students know that other control structures exist (do, while), and that they‚Äôre controlled by boolean logic Apply is a thing Scholars will be familiar with that folks have strong opinions about using apply instead of for loops Scholars will understand that getting the code done is the most important thing, but that good use of apply can be something to develop later to make code run faster, cleaner Scholars will be able to read what an example of apply or s/lapply is doing, so that they can read examples online Scholars will have heard the term ‚Äúlambda function‚Äù ? Scholars will understand that functions can be one-off (ie lambda, function(x){} ), and that‚Äôs okay 4.4 Packages are chunks of code (and sometimes data) Let‚Äôs take a look at your code from the last few days. How would you share this with the other people in the course? R, like other languages, is built on a package system - if you wrap up your code in particular expected ways and put it in particular expected places, it is very easy for others to get and use your code side note link for interested students, easy of making pakcages (for advanced advanced) 4.4.1 first stop - CRAN CRAN library(&quot;stringdist&quot;) exercise - get the stringdist library, use it exercise - get a new viz layer, use it 4.4.2 next stop - github library(&quot;devtools&quot;) exercise - install devtools exercise - pull a package off github‚Ä¶.. ? maybe some sort of viz again? problems with this 4.4.3 finally - Bioconductor üò¨ How to install Bioconductor Scholars will know how to install Bioconductor package from CRAN Scholars will know how to find and install packages from Bioconductor explore the namespace for a package, ie ?packagename:: and TAB or ?packagename:: how to print out all the packages you have loaded 4.5 Finding more help and documentation Need a problem ?geom_line ?stringdist Objective X.X: Scholars will know how to get official docs ( ? ) and how to skim/read these Objective X.X: Scholars will see how easy it is to use a search engine to try and find other answers Objective X.X: Scholars will understand the intention of the Slack being a learning community, or something (set expectations about this) Source up problems from the class? Demo a weird plot idea, search for how to do it on stack overflow? Maybe how to change the color of facet labels in a ggplot facet graph, that‚Äôs a bit tricky and demonstrates why base R is important‚Ä¶ 4.6 Reproducibility and sharing think about this think about the next person coming along, or yourself in 3 months links on syllabus for more info all sorts of automated stuff you can do Ask Darach if you want details, or read the paper.‚Ü© "],["appendix.html", "5 Appendix 5.1 Additional tutorials 5.2 More challenges 5.3 Rmd example of code chunk 5.4 How to edit this document", " 5 Appendix 5.1 Additional tutorials a list of tutorials 5.1.1 sub sub section 5.2 More challenges Challenge yourself Extra datasets ere 5.3 Rmd example of code chunk knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 5.1: Here is a nice table!

Error with what is in docs/? Do git checkout docs/ to remove the edits to those, then pull again. Make or edit the files whose name starts with two digits and ends with Rmd, Like 01-day3.Rmd. Feel free to run that in Rstudio or whatever. To test the full site, sun ./_build.sh to build the entire site. ( Can Rstudio run this as a terminal ??? There may be another way to do this in Rstudio - I believe they develop the bookdown package? ) The entire site is in docs/ because that is what github wants. When done, add and commit your changes. git add 02-day4.Rmd # or whatever you changed git commit -m &quot;nice commit message of what you have done&quot; git checkout docs/ # this prevents errors from docs not matching what&#39;s published git pull # to make sure current git push # to push it up to github 5.4.3 Publishing onto the main page, so it‚Äôs hosted at the URL git pull # to make sure current # if there are conflicts, then run git checkout docs/ # this prevents errors from docs not matching what&#39;s published # if not, you can skip this step! ./_build.sh # builds the site in docs/ git add docs/* # adds the entire site to the repo git commit -m &quot;updated site&quot; git push # to push it up to github "]]
