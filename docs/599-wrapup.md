## Conclusion

Today we covered:

- Workflows
- Project organization
- Strings, patterns and lengths
- Loops
- Packages
- Finding help

And we gave this a try with starting one of a handful of different projects

We hope you are better oriented and prepared to build scalable workflows in 
R in your summer work and share these with others, 
as you make your contribution to our collective scientific endeavour.
