## Using tidyverse

* When it comes to manipulating data frames (creating new columns, filtering, etc.) - tidyverse is your friend!
* Scholars will understand the complex socio-technical context of tidyverse, ie that it's not base R but oh boy it's popular and well supported by a company - but not base R
* Scholars know that tidyverse/dplyr takes a more database-like approach to moving data tables around
* Scholars can identify and predict what a magrittr pipe does
* Scholars can pipe some stuff between functions, and write that out in a script
* Scholars can filter data tables, select and rename columns
* Scholars can mutate columns
* Scholars understand what group_by is doing
* Scholars can use group_by to summarise variables
