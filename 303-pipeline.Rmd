## Data exploration pipelines

Approach: an Rmd tutorial with a simple dataset in R. This is meant to be a motivation for what one can do in R, not necessarily understanding syntax of every function/operation used
Topics/Exercises
Present a conceptual framework for a pipeline - more of a tutorial
Use an Rmd file for this and introduce how to navigate the Rmd file
Scholars can execute a given Rmd
Scholars can modify a given Rmd
Scholars know what the major pieces of an Rmd are (code and not code)
Scholars know about caching and arguments for code chunks
Scholars know how to make their own new Rmd file and run it
Load a simple dataset in R - the iris dataset, peek at the table with head, summarize the columns, and make a scatter plot with base R. This introduces several topics 
Requires: interacting with R, calling functions, and saving variables
