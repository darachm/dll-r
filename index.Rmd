## Structure and resources

### This syllabus and videos

We've made this doc for your reference, and it's our living document of
"slides" and reference.

We also made short videos for teaching, so that any mini-lectures 
are concise and complete. It also allows us to work as assistants.
These are uploaded on Youtube, and should be accessible via the embeds on
this site.
