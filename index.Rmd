# Workshop introduction

## Course intent

Here is what the course is trying to do.
We want to get you to a basic framework so you can work with someone 
effectively.
That framework is getting you oriented with the basics and how to 
think about figuring out tasks in R.

## Structure and resources

### This syllabus and videos

We've made this doc for your reference, and it's our living document of
"slides" and reference.

We also made short videos for teaching, so that any mini-lectures 
are concise and complete. It also allows us to work as assistants.
These are uploaded on Youtube, and should be accessible via the embeds on
this site.

### Slack channel

We are going to set this up to be a good place to go for ideas/help.

The channel is called .... what?

## Expectations

1. Don't be a jerk
1. Pull together
