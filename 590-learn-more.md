## Finding more help and documentation

Need a problem

```{r,eval=F}
?geom_line
```

```{r,eval=F}
?stringdist
```

Objective X.X: Scholars will know how to get official docs ( ? ) and how to skim/read these

Objective X.X: Scholars will see how easy it is to use a search engine to try and find other answers

Objective X.X: Scholars will understand the intention of the Slack being a learning community, or something (set expectations about this)

Source up problems from the class?

Demo a weird plot idea, search for how to do it on stack overflow?

Maybe how to change the color of facet labels in a ggplot facet graph, that's a bit tricky and demonstrates why base R is importantâ€¦

## Reproducibility and sharing

think about this

think about the next person coming along, or yourself in 3 months
